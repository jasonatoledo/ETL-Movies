# ETL-Movies Deliverables & Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with performing ETL: Extract, Transform, and Load functions on several datasets. These datasets included data from Kaggle.com and from a raw wiki JSON file. The Extract step is fairly simple and not too time consuming. The transform steps I went through in the module could be clarified further as some of it went way over my head. The Load function is fairly straight forward and I did not have any difficulties connecting to the postgres DB.

The deliverables included refactoring the code from the modules and making fully comprehensive, cleaned versions of the ETL scripts.
